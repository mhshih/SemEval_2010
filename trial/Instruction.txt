  TASK 17: All-words Word Sense Disambiguation on a Specific Domain

			     (WSD-domain)



Instructions for participations:
---------------------------------

At test time, the pariticipants will need to tag the marked nouns, adjectives
and verbs, including multiword units, in the test documents. 

The sense inventory is based on WordNet and will specify target words, 
multiwords and senses to be tagged.

The organizers also include some background documents, which the participants 
can use to tune their WSD algorithms.

We recommend that potential participants join the task mailing list:
